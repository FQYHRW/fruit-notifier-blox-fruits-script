### ⚙️ Popular Features in Blox Fruits Scripts

Below are the most commonly used features in top-rated scripts for Blox Fruits. Each one is designed to help players save time and optimize gameplay:

#### 1. 🌾 Auto Farm
Auto farming is one of the most requested features. It lets your character automatically complete quests, defeat mobs, and collect XP and rewards — even while you’re away from your keyboard. It supports farming for specific weapons, fruits, or swords.

#### 2. 🔍 Devil Fruit Sniper / Fruit ESP
This function scans the server for any devil fruit spawns and shows you exactly where they are. You can even teleport directly to the location and grab the fruit before others do. Great for tracking rare types like **Dragon**, **Leopard**, or **Venom**.

#### 3. 🗺️ Teleport to Islands, Bosses & Chests
No more manual sailing. The teleport feature allows players to jump between zones, instantly reach bosses, or collect high-value chests. Some scripts even come with waypoint saving for favorite grinding spots.

#### 4. 🎮 Auto Mastery Up
Training your fruit, sword, or gun mastery can take hours. With this feature, your character will automatically grind mobs using your chosen skills until your mastery reaches its max potential. Perfect for unlocking hidden abilities fast.

#### 5. 👁️ ESP (Wallhack for Players/Items)
ESP shows outlines or tags for key items, NPCs, bosses, and other players — even through terrain. This gives you a tactical advantage in both PvE and PvP scenarios.

#### 6. 🎯 Auto Skills & Combat Enhancements
Want your character to chain abilities or switch targets without clicking? Auto skill features allow combo execution and optimized damage rotation without manual input.

#### 7. 💬 Auto Questing
Automatically accepts, completes, and turns in quests relevant to your level. This ensures uninterrupted XP gain and steady progress through the leveling system.
